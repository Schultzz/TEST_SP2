# Test_SP2 - Morten Laursen

####Code coverage exercise

####1. How much of the code is covered by test cases to start out?

This project was done in a test-first fashion. The code coverage shows that some packages are very well tested.
####2. Could and should the code coverage of your project be raised?
It depends among the packages. As a role of thumb 80% code coverage are by some standards enough. It really depends on the project.
In this case it is our REST-API that is not tested, but our backend/logic is greatly tested.
####3. How? Do not implement anything, but identify the parts of the code to focus on if more test cases were to be implemented.
By mocking our Back-end away, we could create usefull API-tests and thus making our code coverage much higher.
